# Arduino Project Week

Project Involves Arduino Uno

# Libraries include:
  1. Wire.h
  2. RTClib
  3. LiquidCrystal
  
# Hardware Used:
  - 2 x Arduino Uno 
  - 2 x BreadBoards
  - 1 x DS1307 Module V03 (Clock)
  - 1 x LED 
  - 1 x Buzzer
  - 1 x Button
  - 1 x Lcd Display
 
# Finished: 
  ** First Arduino:
    The buzzer and led should turn on if the button is pressed.
    The clock should use pc date and time and count up.
    The Data should be tranferred to the other Arduino Uno.
    
  ** Second Arduino:
    The Arduino receives data from the first arduino and stores it.
    The Arduino then converts the data to char arrays.
    Then it sends the data to the lcd display.
    
# After thoughts: 
  The requirement of changing the variable of the data from the clock to char and sending that to the other arduino.
  Instead it has been done inside the Second Arduino.
  
** Done all 8 part assignments. 
Which include the addition of the lcd display.
